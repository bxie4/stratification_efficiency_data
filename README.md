This is the original data for the paper "Efficiency of Stratification for Ensemble Docking using Reduced Ensembles".

There are 4 systems in this "stratification_efficiency_data" directory. In each system, there are receptor dcd files, ligand mol2 files,
docking scores and distance matrices.

Each system receptor contains 4 dcd files which were named by the time order as part 1,2,3,4. 
In each dcd files there are 200 frames. In total there are 800 frames for each system, and 800 frames represented 80ns MD simulation.
